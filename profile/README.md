## About MoroJS

MoroJS is a modern framework and ecosystem designed to eliminate the pain points of traditional Node.js frameworks.  
We focus on creating tools and patterns that are:

- **Multi-Runtime** – Run the same code on Node.js, Vercel Edge, AWS Lambda, and Cloudflare Workers.  
- **Intelligent** – Automatic middleware ordering with chainable, schema-first APIs.  
- **Type-Safe** – Full validation and inference powered by Zod and TypeScript.  
- **Functional** – Built on pure functional programming patterns.  
- **Optimized** – Minimal runtime overhead with high performance across environments.  

Our mission is to give developers a framework that is reliable, production-ready, and adaptable across any platform.
