## About Us

MoroJS is an open-source team dedicated to creating **practical, production-ready developer tools**.  
Our mission is to make building modern applications easier by focusing on:

- **Performance** – Frameworks and runtimes that deliver low-latency, high-throughput apps.  
- **Simplicity** – APIs that are easy to learn and consistent to use.  
- **Portability** – The same code runs across servers, edge functions, and serverless platforms.  
- **Type Safety** – Strong guarantees and better developer experience through TypeScript and Zod.  

We believe developers should spend less time wrestling with framework limitations and more time building features.
