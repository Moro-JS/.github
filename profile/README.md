## About Us

MoroJS is an open-source team dedicated to creating **practical, production-ready developer tools**.  
Our mission is to make building modern applications easier by focusing on:

- **Performance** – Frameworks and runtimes that deliver low-latency, high-throughput apps.  
- **Simplicity** – APIs that are easy to learn and consistent to use.  
- **Portability** – The same code runs across servers, edge functions, and serverless platforms.  
- **Type Safety** – Strong guarantees and better developer experience through TypeScript and Zod.  

We believe developers should spend less time wrestling with framework limitations and more time building features.

## Our Work

### Moro (Core Framework)  
[`@morojs/moro`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@morojs/moro) is our flagship project:  
a **multi-runtime, intelligent-routing framework** designed for Node.js, Edge, Lambda, and Workers.  

Key goals:  
- Automatic middleware ordering.  
- Schema-first, type-safe APIs.  
- Minimal runtime overhead.  
- Pure functional design with no decorators.  

### Examples & Ecosystem  
We maintain an [Examples Repository](https://github.com/MoroJS/examples) showcasing best practices and reference implementations.  
Additional ecosystem tools will be released as the project evolves.
